                        <p class="opening-excerpt">A little over 2 years ago, I embarked on a new journey in my career, leaving my stable development job with a public company to join a seed stage startup. This is not a unqiue origin story, but one that is repeated every day in startup heavy areas throughout the world. Despite the number of people taking on this challenge, it doesn't seem to get any easier. No one has come up with a the blueprint for early stage success. </p>

                        <p>It is certainly not for lack of trying, as there are vast amounts of advice on the subject. Some from people who have succeded, and even more from those who have failed. Often delivered with the benefit of a little thing called hindsight, and mostly aimed at founders. However, there is very little practical advice for those of us in the middle of our startup journey and literally in the middle of our respective organizations. What can those of us with a long road ahead of us, and not always in direct control do to make this whole adventures a successful one? This is where I hope I can help.</p>

                        <p>No, this doesn't mean that I have found the blueprint, but what I have done is learned some of these lessons the old fashioned way...by making my own mistakes. By sharing what I've learned, I'm hoping it will help you make a few less mistakes, or at the very least, give you some comfort in that fact that most of us don't have it figured out. </p>

                        <p>Chances are if you are at an early stage startup, you are doing some, if not all, of your job in this setting for the first time. Even for experienced practitioners, the early stage version of your job probably looks very different from what you've done in the past. What this means is you are going to be making mistakes, lots of them. And your team? Yep, they will be making them too. It is the empathy you have for this fact that can make or break you and your team.</p>
                        
                        <p class="closing-excerpt">The first step, is being realistic about who you are and where are you are in your career development. Are you accepting of the fact that you don't have all the answers? Have you wrapped your head around how to recieve and act on feedback? Are you ok with the fact that today's mistake won't be your last? This part is key, because if you are unable to handle these things when it comes to yourself, you are going to find it nigh impossible to empathize with what your team is going through with theirs. You will become defensive about your own place, and it will color your interactions with the rest of your team.</p>
