    <meta name="description" content="For years, we have been debating whether designers should know how to code. We seem to always come to the same conclusion: Yes! But why aren't designers heading in droves to learn the development side of things then.

                        <p class="opening-excerpt">The world of front-end development has become a complicated place. For years we were free to live a life free from the command prompt, from frameworks, from fancy build and deploy processes. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were our only friends. But over the last few years, our toolbox has expanded at a mind-blowing pace. Preprocessors, MV* frameworks, script loaders, package managers, templating frameworks, the list goes on and on. It has become a tremendous amount to manage.</p>

                        <p>It was only a matter of time before we came up with tools to handle…well, our tools. Task runners were devised to help us wrangle the plethora of things you need to optimize, compile, and otherwise manage inside of your projects as you include more and more tools into your repertoire. Grunt.js is one such task runner. An open-source, command line tool built with JavaScript, meant to handle the ever increasing laundry list of tasks we encounter on a daily basis. If you can write JSON, you can use Grunt to automate file compilation, image optimization, pre-processing, and tons more.</p>

                        <h2>Installation</h2>

                        <p>Installation of Grunt is a breeze. To get started we will need to install Node, which can be downloaded and installed direct from <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS.org</a>. Once that is complete, open up a new terminal window and run the following:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -g grunt-cli</code></pre>

                        <p>This will install the Grunt CLI globally on your system, but not Grunt itself. The Grunt CLI will run the version of Grunt you install for a particular project, allowing you to run different versions for different projects.</p>
        
                        <p>Grunt relies on two files. Gruntfile.js and package.json. Package.json manages your project settings and the plugins your project will load. <a href="http://gruntjs.com/plugins" target="_blank">Plugins</a> are really the power behind Grunt. There is one for practically any task you can think of. The Grunt team even maintains a library of officially supported plugins. Plus, if for some reason you can't find one that will do exactly what you need, you can create your own. Gruntfile.js is where you initialize these plugins, configure and run your tasks, set configuration variables, etc.</p>

                        <h2>Configuration</h2>

                        <p>Let's start out with a bootstrap configuration before we dive into the nuts and bolts. First, we'll look at what makes up a package.json file:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  'name': 'my-project-name',
  'version': '0.1.0',
  'devDependencies': {
  }
}</code></pre>

                        <p>What we have is a simple JSON object with basic information about our project. ‘Name’ is just an identifier for your project, this can be whatever value you like. ‘Version’ is the version number of our particular project, which you can increment manually. Last, and most importantly, is the ‘devDependencies’ object. This contains all the required packages for our project.</p>

                        <p>The first dependency we will install is Grunt itself. This may seem weird initially, but makes a lot more sense when you realize that package.json is not something that is specific to Grunt, but is instead part of Node itself. What you are effectively running is a Node server with Grunt (alongside your other dependencies) installed on it. Grunt is essentially just one Node package that runs tasks using other Node packages. We can install Grunt by heading back to the command line and running the following from our project root:</p>
    
                        <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install grunt --save-dev</code></pre>

                        <p>This will add the latest version of Grunt to your project's package.json:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  'name': 'my-project-name',
  'version': '0.1.0',
  'devDependencies': {
    'grunt': '~0.4.1'
  }
}</code></pre>

                        <p>I mentioned in the beginning that you were not installing Grunt directly, but instead a CLI that runs Grunt. Each project you want to run Grunt with will have its own version. This is done to make code easier to maintain when Grunt updates, allowing you to upgrade Grunt on a per project basis. Another safeguard to ensure safe updating is the versioning notation. To avoid accidentally upgrading, most dependencies are installed using a tilde version range. This restricts the automatic upgrading of packages to only minor versions, hopefully saving you from possible code-breaking changes. For example a dependency with a version rage of ~0.4.1 will upgrade automatically until 0.4.9, but would not automatically update to 0.5.0. Most of this is handled automatically for you when a dependency is installed, but it is still good to know how and why it works this way.</p>

                        <p>For now, our Gruntfile.js file will remain very basic. All your tasks will be wrapped in a single Grunt function:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = function(grunt) {
  // Do grunt-related things in here
}</code></pre>

                        <p>Inside of this we will start with some basic configuration that initializes Grunt and points it to our package.json file:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({

    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),

  });

};</code></pre>

                        <p>This gives us what we need to start adding our first task for Grunt to run.</p>

                        <h2>Your First Task</h2>

                        <p>We are going to start with a simple example, and something we always have a need for, image optimization. Using the official <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-imagemin" target="_blank">imagemin plugin</a>, we are going to have Grunt run a task that optimizes all our images. First things first, let's install the plugin by running the following from the root of your project:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install grunt-contrib-imagemin --save-dev</code></pre>

                        <p>If you are running this on a Mac, you may get a pop-up to install a dependency library required to optimize your images. Follow the instructions in the linked Apple knowledge base article, and re-run the above command.</p>

                        <p>This will fetch the latest version of the imagemin plugin, as well as automatically add it to your package.json using the previously discussed tilde version range. To finish things up we need to initialize the plugin from our Gruntfile.js:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({

    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),

  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-imagemin');

};</code></pre>

                        <p>This is the process you will follow for installing plugins going forward. Most plugins' documentation will include how to initiate the download from Node Package Manager (NPM), as well as the argument to pass ’loadNpmTasks’ to load the plugin. The next step is to configure the task. Each task in Grunt is configured as a JSON object within Gruntfile.js. Let's go through a basic configuration for imagemin:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">grunt.initConfig({
  imagemin: {                          // Task
    static: {                          // Target
      options: {                       // Target options
        optimizationLevel: 3
      },
      files: {                         // Dictionary of files
        'dist/img.png': 'src/img.png', // 'destination': 'source'
        'dist/img.jpg': 'src/img.jpg',
        'dist/img.gif': 'src/img.gif'
      }
    }
  }
});</code></pre>

                        <p>The main object for each task is usually the name of the plugin. The first child object is usually, but does not have to be, named after the target of the task. In this case we are calling it static. This is a great pattern to use, as you can run subtasks based on these child objects (ie. grunt imagemin.static). Next we, have two children: The first is ‘options’, which allows you the pass a configuration object. In this case, we are going to pass it an optimization level for our compressed images. Note this only affects the static subtask. Refer to each plugins documentation for a list of available options.</p>

                        <p>The next element is a file matching pattern. This tells the plugin what images to modify. There are <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Configuring-tasks#files" target="_blank">several accepted formats</a> for this object. I prefer to use the <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Configuring-tasks#files-array-format" target="_blank">Files Array format</a>, as it allows you to declare several source locations per destination, while also allowing you to pass multiple mappings per object. In this example, we will pass it a couple specific images to optimize.</p>

                        <p>Now we have enough to run our first Grunt task. Pull up your command line and run the following from your terminal:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">grunt imagemin.static</code></pre>

                        <p>You should now see some logs in terminal with the results of our optimizations, as well as new, compressed images in our destination folder. Now each time we run this command, Grunt will run a task that optimizes the images we pass in the file object. While this is not always the case, this particular plugin will cache what images it has optimized, and only optimize the ones that are new or changed.</p>

                        <h2>Dynamic File Paths</h2>

                        <p>Now that we have your first task out of the way, we'll work on making it more useful. In a practical application, you probably do not want to continually update a giant list of files to your JSON object just to optimize them. Instead, we can configure our task do this automatically:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">grunt.initConfig({
  imagemin: {                          // Task
    static: {                          // Target
      options: {                       // Target options
        optimizationLevel: 3
      },
      files: {                         // Dictionary of files
        'dist/img.png': 'src/img.png', // 'destination': 'source'
        'dist/img.jpg': 'src/img.jpg',
        'dist/img.gif': 'src/img.gif'
      }
    },
    dynamic: {                         // Another target
      files: [{
        expand: true,                  // Enable dynamic expansion
        cwd: 'src/',                   // Src matches are relative to this path
        src: ['src/**/*.{png,jpg,gif}'],   // Actual patterns to match
        dest: 'dist/'                  // Destination path prefix
      }]
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>

                        <p>In our new ‘dynamic’ we are now using a slightly different file object format that allows us to pass in a couple new options. The ‘expand’ property tells a plugin whether or not dynamically expand your target list, which basically just means it will find every file within the source object you specify. This way, if you add a new folder or file, you will not have to update your source list manually. The ‘cwd’ property sets the root that all your file paths will be relative to. In this example, we are going to set it to our ‘src’ folder. Next, we pass our familiar ‘src’ property, this time using some wildcards. ‘**/*’ tells imagemin to target any file in any child folders. This combined with ‘expand’ being set to true will cover any new folders and files within src. We are also limiting it to only PNG, JPG, and GIF files. Lastly, we pass a destination like in our previous task. We only need to declare the root ‘dest’ folder, as Grunt will retain the paths and file structure of the source folder when it moves images over to our destination.</p>

                        <p>Let's give this one a whirl by putting the following into terminal:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">grunt imagemin.dynamic</code></pre>

                        <p>Now any image we add in the ‘src’ folder will be optimized and placed in its relative location within the destination folder without us updating our file list.</p>

                        <h2>Running Multiple Tasks</h2>

                        <p>Grunt does not limit you to running just one task at a time. You can also run a series of tasks with a single command. To demonstrate this, we will continue working on our image optimization workflow. First, we will install our second plugin: <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-svg2png" target="_blank">SVG2PNG</a>. This plugin will convert any SVG you pass it, into a PNG to use as a fallback for older browsers. Follow what we covered above to install SVG2PNG into our project. Once that is done, add a new task object to our Gruntfile.js:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">svg2png: {
        all: {
            // specify files in array format with multiple src-dest mapping
            files: [{
                expand: true,                  // Enable dynamic expansion
                cwd: 'src/',                   // Src matches are relative to this path
                src: ['src/**/*.{svg}'],   // Actual patterns to match
                dest: 'dist/'                  // Destination path prefix
            }]
        }
    }</code></pre>

                        <p>This should look very similar to how we handled image optimization. We have created a subtask called ‘all’ and are passing it a dynamic list of SVGs. Those are then converted and placed into a ‘png’ folder within the ‘src’ folder. Now we could just run this task like before, followed by our dynamic image optimization task to optimize the generated PNGs, but there is a quicker way. We'll accomplish that by creating a new section of our GruntFile.js and register our first custom task using the following at the bottom of our Grunt function:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">grunt.registerTask('process-images', ['svg2png.all', 'imagemin.dynamic']);</code></pre>

                        <p>The registerTask method gets passed 2 arguments: The name of the new task, and an object containing the tasks you want it to run. The tasks are run in the order they appear in the array, and are blocking, meaning the second one will not start until the first one finishes. Now we can go to our terminal and run:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">grunt process-images</code></pre>

                        <p>This will first convert our SVGs in our source folder to PNGs, then will run our dynamic image optimization as before. You can see where this can really save some time. Now with a single command we convert and optimize all our image assets.</p>

                        <h2>Running Tasks Automatically</h2>

                        <p>While what we have up to this point is incredibly useful, we can take it one step further. Grunt has an incredibly useful plugin called <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-watch" target="_blank">Watch</a>. This plugin will monitor specific file/folder patterns and run tasks automatically when it detects changes. This is a great way to make sure we don't forget to run our tasks. Our first step is to install Watch into the project following the usual steps. Once that is done, we can add our new Watch task into our GruntFile.js:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-javascript">watch: {
  images: {
    files: ['**/*src'],
    tasks: ['process-images'],
  },
},</code></pre>

                        <p>We have created an images subtask and passed it folders to watch along with the tasks we want to run when Watch detects a change. Once this is done, head over to terminal and run:</p>

                        <pre><code class="language-bash">grunt watch</code></pre>

                        <p>You will now see a prompt that our Watch task is waiting. Now we simply make a change to any image in the ‘src’ folder, and the Watch task will trigger our custom image processing task in the background. As long as the Watch task is running, this will be done without any interaction from you!</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                        <p class="closing-excerpt">Hopefully this gives you some insight into how powerful Grunt tasks can be along with a solid foundation to start leveraging them in your workflow. Grunt can handle more than just images. Preprocessing, optimizations, file cleanup, cache-busting, there is a near endless list of way to leverage Grunt to streamline your workflow.
