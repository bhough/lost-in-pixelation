                        <p class="opening-excerpt">The road to startup success is a long and arduous one. Despite the number of people who have taken on this challenge, there is no blueprint. It is certainly not for lack of trying, as there are vast amounts of advice on the subject. Some from people who have been wildly successful, and even more from those who have failed miserably, and mostly aimed at founders. Furthermore, it is often delivered with the  all too important benefit of a little thing called hindsight.  What is lacking is practical advice for those of us in the middle of our startup journey and literally in the middle of our respective organizations. What can those of us who are still traveling this road, and not the one driving, do to make a difference? This is where I hope my experience can lend some guidance.</p>

                        <p>This doesn't mean that I have found the blueprint, far from it. But I have learned some of these lessons the old-fashioned way&hellip;by making a lot of mistakes. I'm hoping by sharing  what I have learned from these mistakes, that you might make a few less yourself, or at least take some comfort in that fact that most of us don't have it figured out. </p>

                        <p>A little over 2 years ago, I embarked on a new journey in my career, leaving my stable development job with a public company to join a seed stage startup. This origin story is not uncommon, but one that repeats every day in startup heavy areas all over the world. While I was originally hired as a front-end engineer, it was not long before I had to step into an architect role. As our engineering team grew, my few months of startup experience quickly made me the most experienced guy in the room. That &ldquo;experience&rdquo; did little to bridge the massive gap between being the sole front-end developer at the company and having to craft code and standards that worked across a large team. </p>

                    <div class="prepend-6 column-12 append-6  desktop-prepend-6 desktop-column-12 desktop-append-6 tablet-prepend-1 tablet-column-10 tablet-append-1 phone-column-6 ">

                        <p>During that time I coded us into more boxes than I can count, stood firm on decisions I had to later reverse, and basically did everything short of burn the place down. It was the definition of trial by fire. However, I also learned more in those first few months than I ever would have in a traditional company. Making  a mistake often is the best way to avoid making it again, and it was the support of my team through those mistakes that allowed me to learn what I needed to do to right the ship.</p>

                        <p>This last year, I took on another new challenge, becoming our first official Product Manager, a role I had never done before. Suddenly, I was once again thrust into an uncomfortable position, doing a whole slew of new things and making a mess of things. Reliving this experience reminded me of how important your team's support is when you are trying to grow in your career and as a company in general as we navigate this often bumpy road.</p>

                        <p>Chances are, if you are at an early stage startup, you are doing some, if not all, of your role for the first time. Even for experienced practitioners, the early stage version of your role probably looks very different from what you've done in the past. What this means is, like me, you are going to make mistakes, lots of them. And your team&hellip;they will be making them too. The ability to see your struggle within their's, to empathize with them, can make or break your team.</p>

                        <p>It starts with being realistic about who you are and where you are in your development. Are you accepting of the fact that you don't have all the answers? Have you opened yourself up to receiving and acting on feedback? Can you avoid being discouraged knowing that today's mistake won't be your last? If your reaction to these situations is to go on the defensive, you can only expect the same from those around you. It is this defensiveness that fosters mistrust and ultimately stifles the team. Everyone quickly becomes more concerned with how they are perceived rather than how to learn from the exprience, and make the team better because of it.</p>

                        <p>Startups offer a unique opportunity to jump several rungs on the career ladder very quickly. There is always a new challenge or responsibility awaiting, and most founders will not shy away from letting you take it on. If you go into this experience with the right frame of mind, the sky can truly be the limit. Just know that you will be seeing a lot of things for the first time, and handling them will often require help. Whether that is a tight feedback loop with your team, advice from mentors, or just a support system to pick you up after a misstep, you will be thankful if you have the support of your team.</p>

                        <p>Once you get comfortable with that idea, it becomes an exhilarating experience. That thrill of taking on a challenge that you aren't quite ready for is what startup folks thrive on. Doing all of that with a safety net of a supportive team that helps elevate us further&hellip;well there is no better setup for success. We make each other better, thus making the team better.</p>

                        <p>Sounds great, maybe even magical, right? We're all going to head into work tomorrow, take on some new challenges, support the heck out of each other, and conquer the world! But one thing is missing&hellip;that supportive team that allows us to take on these challenges without fear of failure. That part is not so easy, else we would be succeeding at solving larger problems than, say, <a href="https://doughbies.co/" target="_blank">instant cookie delivery</a>.</p>

                        <p>Empathy is a hard thing because you can not just create it in someone. You need to relate to another's struggle to understand what they are going through. This is not easy for any of us, from the day we enter the workforce we are trained to be protective and cover our asses. Luckily, we are not alone, we know each other's struggle, we know how we want others to react to our mistakes, because it is how we want other to react to ours. We just need to start applying that knowledge when the roles are reversed.</p>

                        <p>This is a powerful realization, as the key to fostering organizational empathy starts with you. If you start empathizing with your team's struggle, you will eventually get the same in return. If you aren't making others feel bad for asking questions, not punishing them for their missteps, providing thoughtful, actionable feedback, you will start seeing the same come your way. When the focus shifts from elevating yourself, to elevating each other, it is amazing the changes you'll see within yourself and your team.</p>

                        <p class="closing-excerpt">The road we have all chosen to travel is a long and windy one. There will be times you need help reading the map, and times you will need to do the navigating. But once you figure out that you aren't in it alone, you can focus on what really matters, providing all of us with cookies on demand!</p>
